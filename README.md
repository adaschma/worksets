## Customised Workspaces - Gnome Shell Extension

Customised Workspaces adds the following features to Gnome Shell workspace usage:

* Custom favourite applications on the dash for each workspace
* Only show applications on the dash when they're running on the active workspace
* Custom background image for each workspace
* Name and save each customisation, set them to autoload on specific workspaces
* Hide the extension once you've configured your preferences to enjoy seamlessly upgraded workspaces in gnome shell
* Compatible with dash-to-dock and dash-to-panel, use with with Auto Move Windows for a complete automated workflow: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/

Each functionality can be turned off so can be used just as a wallpaper manager or as a workspace isolater.
