Customised Workspaces enables creating isolated and customised workspaces.

* Customise the dash to be unique for each workspace, each with their own favourites
* Only show running applications on the dash in their respective workspace
* Choose a custom background image for each workspace
* Minor UI tweaks to the overview workspaces
* Save each customisation, set them to autoload on specific workspaces
* Hide the extension once you've configured your preferences to enjoy seamlessly upgraded workspaces in gnome shell

Compatible for use with any of these extensions to complete your workspace upgrade:

* Dash to Panel - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/
* Dash to Dock - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/
